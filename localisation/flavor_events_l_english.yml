 technic_flavor.1.t:0 "SATELLITE RECONNECTED"
 technic_flavor.1.d:0 "Our scientists have alerted us to an outstanding discovery: An old world satellite is still active and possibly transmitting. We have no idea how its remained operational for so long, but it might have some interesting data if we can connect to it.."
 technic_flavor.1.a:0 "Let's turn the lights back on"
 technic_flavor.1.b:0 "We can’t spare the resources"
 technic_flavor.1.c:0 "Launch The Rocket right now!"
 technic_flavor.2.t:0 "FATAL ERROR"
 technic_flavor.2.d:0 "The research satalite's error is unfortunatly impossible to fix from the Earth. The only route to repair it would be to somehow send a crew up and physically put on a new transmitter."
 technic_flavor.2.a:0 "We can do it"
 technic_flavor.2.a:0 "Its impossible"
 technic_flavor.3.t:0 "WE CAN DO IT!"
 technic_flavor.3.d:0 "We've finally recreated a a rocketry technolgy that should, in concept, be able to launch a crew to the satalite."
 technic_flavor.3.a:0 "It's time"
 technic_flavor.3.b:0 "We can’t spare the resources"
 technic_flavor.4.t:0 "IT'S DONE"
 technic_flavor.4.d:0 "Our crew has successfully intercepted the satalite. It contains not just a mountain of data that will make our research easier, but a message to us today. \n"We send this message to our children. We know. We've given you a world that is worse than any we could imagine. We hope that you can find it within yourselves to forgive us, but we understand that we may not deserve it.""
 technic_flavor.4.a:0 "We forgive you."

 hoxha_flavor.1.t:0 "BUNKER DISCOVERED"
 hoxha_flavor.1.d:0 "In a recent scouting mission, our troops have discovered a bunker containing a group of old comrades who’ve remained hidden. That’s where the good news ends. The worst has been discovered: they're Trots. The public doesn’t know about them, what do we do?"
 hoxha_flavor.1.a:0 "Try to teach them real science"
 hoxha_flavor.1.b:0 "Quietly deport them"
 hoxha_flavor.2.t:0 "THE PARTY IS SPLIT"
 hoxha_flavor.2.d:0 "The first set of classes has been a... success? Around half of the Trots have agreed that he's a revisionist or worse, but now we have a few party members who've changed their alliegence. Our education has gotten harder."
 hoxha_flavor.2.a:0 "We can rebuild."
 hoxha_flavor.2.a:0 "Deport the splitters!"
 hoxha_flavor.3.t:0 "THE PARTY SPLITS AGAIN"
 hoxha_flavor.3.d:0 "While on a public level there's still only one party, in reality there's now dozens of small parties under one large umbrella. Party unity is dead right now. Our central leadership may have no choice but to expel people from the real party."
 hoxha_flavor.3.a:0 "Expel the revisionists"
 hoxha_flavor.3.b:0 "One big party"
 hoxha_flavor.4.t:0 "PURE IDEOLOGY"
 hoxha_flavor.4.d:0 "With the party now united again, we stand to create a network of safe bunkers to defend the national proletariet from all internal and external threats."
 hoxha_flavor.4.a:0 "Success!"

 revel_flavor.1.t:0 "A MODERN CATHEDRAL"
 revel_flavor.1.d:0 "In older eras, great cathedrals were built to the great faiths of the day. These monuments brought togather massive congregations who worked for the common purpose of their faith. Perhaps it would be a good idea to recreate those structures."
 revel_flavor.1.a:0 "Yesterday to today"
 revel_flavor.1.b:0 "We can't afford this"
 revel_flavor.2.t:0 "RESOURCE PROBLEMS"
 revel_flavor.2.d:0 "Despite our infrastucture improvements, we're still having a difficult time transporting materials for construction. If we continue, we could move production to more local factories."
 revel_flavor.2.a:0 "Do that"
 revel_flavor.2.a:0 "Cancel the project"
 revel_flavor.3.t:0 "WASTE OF TIME"
 revel_flavor.3.d:0 "Nothing is more precious than time, but our builders seem to disagree. They claim "a cathedral takes centuries to build", but [ROOT.GetLeader] knows otherwise. With more factories construction can be completed within a year."
 revel_flavor.3.a:0 "Tempus Non Expectantibus"
 revel_flavor.3.b:0 "Move to the backburner"
 revel_flavor.4.t:0 "THE TEMPLE COMPLETE"
 revel_flavor.4.d:0 "The temple to our ideals has been complete. Our citizens have come from around the nation to participate in grand cermonies to enrich their lives. Additionally, many have agreed to join our army in support. We have succeeded"
 revel_flavor.4.a:0 "Brilliant"

 posad_flavor.1.t:0 "COMET SIGHTED"
 posad_flavor.1.d:0 "Across the night sky last night, a brilliant group of comets flew. And the night before that. And the night before that. These comets can't just be a coincidence, we must investigate this stellar phenomenon!"
 posad_flavor.1.a:0 "It's an omen! Investigate!"
 posad_flavor.1.b:0 "If only we had comet sense..."
 posad_flavor.2.t:0 "HOW TO OBSERVE THEM?"
 posad_flavor.2.d:0 "Our top scientists have proposed we build a massive series of RADAR dishes to detect the comets as they enter our atmosphere. That makes sense to [ROOT.GetLeader]. But what about the party?"
 posad_flavor.2.a:0 "Everyone's on board!"
 posad_flavor.2.a:0 "They disagree"
 posad_flavor.3.t:0 "KNOCK ONE OUT"
 posad_flavor.3.d:0 "Our scientists have returned with an outstanding idea: divert all ppower to the RADAR for one short, but massive burt to slow a comet's descent to the planet. There is the risk that it could hit some infrastrucure, but it might be worth the risk."
 posad_flavor.3.a:0 "We'll manage. Fire!"
 posad_flavor.3.b:0 "Hold on here"
 posad_flavor.4.t:0 "WE'VE AQUIRED THE COMET"
 posad_flavor.4.d:0 "The plan was a success! After a search, we've tracked down the debries. In the factory rubble, we tracked down both the remains of comet and a downed statalite of unkown origin. What likely happened is a large comet knocked a variety of satalites out of their orbit. Where did the satalite and comet come from though?"
 posad_flavor.4.a:0 "We'll research!"

 raid_flavor.1.t:0 "LOOT SPLITTING"
 raid_flavor.1.d:0 "The last big raid was pretty successful. It could’ve been bigger though. Some of the generals are pushing for a bigger share to hire more troops. [Leader] doesn’t think they need it."
 raid_flavor.1.a:0 "Their payment is expirience."
 raid_flavor.1.b:0 "Fine, but hire more men."
 raid_flavor.2.t:0 "UNDERLING GROVELS"
 raid_flavor.2.d:0 "One of [Root.GetLeader]'s many underlings have come up to them today and requested men so that they could raid one of our neighbors. Granting the request would win loyalty, but can we spare the men?"
 raid_flavor.2.a:0 "Take these forces"
 raid_flavor.2.a:0 "Denied"
 raid_flavor.3.t:0 "MARRIAGE"
 raid_flavor.3.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] is single, which has been the source of some mockery amongst the generals. There's two options: a lovely and beautiful socialite woman or a well-regarded general."
 raid_flavor.3.a:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] and the general"
 raid_flavor.3.b:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] and the socialite"
 raid_flavor.3.c:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] and everyone"
 raid_flavor.3.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] and the trains"
 raid_flavor.4.t:0 "UNDER CONTROL"
 raid_flavor.4.d:0 "Across [ROOT.GetNameDef], people know [ROOT.GetLeader]'s name. They say it with a mix of fear and respect. The greatest army across the land is know well known."
 raid_flavor.4.a:0 "Perfection"
